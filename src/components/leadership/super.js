        <h2>Supervisor</h2>
          <h3><ins>Typical Questions</ins></h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Why do you want to be a supervisor?</li>
               It aligns with my life goals.  I find meaning in expanded
               horizons and increased responsibility.  I have researched and
               bought in on the idea that a greater stewardship gives an
               increased sense of self and purpose.  It also has fringe benefits
               like greater capacity for freedom in life.
              <li>What do you bring to the table?</li>
                I am good at breaking down complex systems into simple question
                answer methodologies.  I am a good teacher and can organize
                thoughts into a comprehensive system.
              <li>How do you handle people who won't do what they are told?</li>
                First I check for ignorance. I ask them why they are doing
                different then instructed. I can help ignorance of
                incompetence.  I can't help laziness or combative natures.
                People who aren't willing to change to help themselves will never
                be good employees.  Their goals will never align with company
                goals.  If they are competant and not ignorant, then they are
                lazy or combative.  That is a quick trip toward being let go.
              <li>What are some examples of your leadership?</li>
                On Raptor, for North Bay, West Bay, Propellant pads, and
                densification systems I planned the work, calculated the hours,
                ordered parts, built cost analysis, led the work and gave updates
                in terms of man hours and percentage done.<br />
                I have been a source of information for techs for quite a while<br />
                In diving my job, when not diving, I coordinated the
                communication between our team and other companies, directed
                tasks going from mainenance of life support equipment to
                launching of dive stages.<br />
              <li>What do you want to acomplish in this position?</li>
                I want to focus on increasing efficiency of asset use.  There
                are certain principles that are nearly universal.  I want to
                apply my understanding of those principles in the context of
                this position.  These are the concepts of efficiency.
              <li>How do you decide between conflicting priorities?</li>
                First is priorities from the tech manager.  If I disagree with
                those priorities I bring that up with the manager.  Once he
                makes a decision with new information, then I take that priority
                as my own.  In the case of equl priority, set it up on an
                important/ urgent chart.  If that doesn't reveal anything, work
                from the most efficient use of assets.  That means the most
                worker output for the given period of time.  Consider show
                stoppers.
              <li>What will be your biggest difficulty in this position?</li>
                Getting to know what motivates people without imposing my own
                understanding on their answers.
              <li>What do you do about bad attitudes/gossip?</li>
                Let them know it isn't productive.  If they have complaints,
                they should bring them up with me and we can discuss them.
                Complaining helps nothing if it isn't done in a way to make
                changes.
              <li>How are you with the software?</li>
                I have focused on PLC for the past few months and shoring up
                some of my competencies. I think the software will come with
                usage.  I know how to approach learning.  Familiarity is what I
                need to work toward.  I just need to use them.
              <li>How do you learn things with which you are not familiar?</li>
                First I ask myself what the point is of it all.  Once I
                understand the purpose of it, I can begin breaking the subject
                into sections that are easily discriminated one from the other.
                After that I begin splitting those sections into tasks where
                apropriate.  i then ask myself what is all the information I
                need to accomplish that low level task. I design a set of
                questions that act like a flow chart to help make decisions.
              <li>How do you handle things not going your way?</li>
                They always go my way unless I am given bad information from a
                source where there is no more access to information. If I am
                forced to rely on bad information, then things don't go my way.
                Otherwise things have always gone my way because they went the
                way I prepared for.  I have to accept when I wasn't prepared.
                I just want to learn and improve.  I don't spend too much time
                asking why did this happen to me.  I would rather spend time
                learning how I can make it not happen again.

                <li>All leadership positions exist to multiply the output of the crew</li>
                <li>Pass the vision from managers down to the technician level</li>
                <li>Provide a workplace that is both efficient and healthy and provides value to workers so that this is the best place to work</li>
              </ol>
            <h4>Technician</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Do work that has a net value higher than the costs of their employment</li>
                <li>Have goals that align with the goals of the company</li>
                <li>Be a net positive for the team</li>

            </ol>
          <h3><ins>Assets and efficiencies</ins></h3>
            Efficiency is maximizing the use of assets.  Efficiency in the use
            of one asset will almost always come at eh cost of another asset.
            The goal is to maximize efficiency of as many assets while having
            minimal cost of the remaining assets.<br />

            <h4>Asset Management principles</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Multi-purpose stock(Everyone should have a towel)</li>
                  Buys- Allows for increase in scrappiness, decrease in area taken up
                  by stock, cuts down on long lead times, less waste in
                  overpurchasing, creates familiarity with equipment, reduces
                  time to build and troubleshoot.<br />
                  Costs- Precision could be lost if good decisions aren't made
                  on equipment.<br />
                <li>Acountable and recordable Complexity(Why are we doing this???)</li>
                  Buys- Gets rid of tribal knowledge, keeps us from making the
                  same mistakes, gets rid of unnecesary equipment, save money
                  cost of additional complexity, technicians are happy because
                  they feel capable.<br />
                  Costs- time to record explainations, requires research for
                  initial decisions<br />
                <li>Process Standardization</li>
                  Buys- Faster build times, availability of information,
                  understanding of standards, reduced waste, reduced rework,
                  happy workers<br />
                  Costs- Less flexibility in outlying situations or creation of
                  standardization for outlyer, long period of decision making<br />
                <li>Output per hour worked viewpoint</li>
                  Action- Have as few people working on a problem as possible as
                  many hours as possible in the day<br />
                  Buys- Higher output in extended periods, increase in output
                  verses cost of an employee, employees feel more ownership,
                  more time spent doing important things<br />
                  Costs- Less progress in the very short term, if not done right
                  can lead to worker fatigue<br />
                <li>Workforce empowerment</li>
                  Action- Make information accessible, make training a priority,
                  combine weak people with strong people, determine abilities,
                  test proficiency, Set list of provable knowledge requirements,
                  teach in terms of proficiency.<br />
                  Buys- More flexible workers, increase in work output, worker
                  morale better because of pride in work, complex tools can get
                  more use to justify costs, skillsets can be quantified,
                  workforce can be applied better, faster builds and
                  troubleshooting, workers feel valuable, takes away claims of
                  knowledge where it doesn't exist.<br />
                  Costs- Time to develop material for consumption<br />
                <li>Ergonomic Design</li>
                  Action- Standardize ways of building stands that acomodate
                  ease of access and isolation from danger<br />
                  Buys- Less workforce injury, increases morale, reduces
                  troubleshooting time, increases longevity of the workers.<br />
                  Costs- Requires development of standard practices, purpose
                  driven construction.<br />

                  Action- Get long build items away from explosions<br />
                  Buys- Quicker recovery from anomolies, less rework<br />
                  Costs- some cost in longer runs on certain items and more planning<br />
