          When you joined this Church . . . you [speaking to Isaac Behunnin]
          left the neutral ground, and you never can get back on to it. Should
          you forsake the Master you enlisted to serve it will be by the
          instigation of the evil one.
          -Quoted by Daniel Tyler, in "Recollections of the Prophet Joseph
           Smith," Juvenile Instructor, Aug. 15, 1892, 492.

          The Book of Mormon is a record of the forefathers of our western tribes
          of Indians; having been found through the ministration of an holy angel,
          and translated into our own language by the gift and power of God, after
          having been hid up in the earth for the last fourteen hundred years,
          containing the word of God which was delivered unto them.
          -History of the Church 1:315.

          The spirit, power, and calling of Elijah is, that ye have power to
          hold the key of the revelation, ordinances, oracles, powers and
          endowments of the fullness of the Melchizedek Priesthood and of the
          kingdom of God on the earth; and to receive, obtain, and perform all
          the ordinances belonging to the kingdom of God, even unto the turning
          of the hearts of the fathers unto the children, and the hearts of the
          children unto the fathers, even those who are in heaven.
          -History of the Church, 6:251; spelling modernized.

          Ever keep in exercise the principle of mercy, and be ready to forgive
          our brother on the first intimations of repentance, and asking
          forgiveness; and should we even forgive our brother, or even our
          enemy, before he repent or ask forgiveness, our heavenly Father would
          be equally as merciful unto us.

          One of the most pleasing scenes that can occur on earth, when a sin has
          been committed by one person against another, is, to forgive that sin;
          and then according to the sublime and perfect pattern of the Savior,
          pray to our Father in heaven to forgive him also.

          God hath not revealed anything to Joseph, but what He will make known
          unto the Twelve, and even the least Saint may know all things as fast
          as he is able to bear them.

          If you do not accuse each other, God will not accuse you. If you have
          no accuser you will enter heaven, and if you will follow the
          revelations and instructions which God gives you through me, I will
          take you into heaven as my back load. If you will not accuse me, I
          will not accuse you. If you will throw a cloak of charity over my
          sins, I will over yours—for charity covereth a multitude of sins.

          God Almighty is my shield; and what can man do if God is my friend? I
          shall not be sacrificed until my time comes; then I shall be offered
          freely.

        I calculate to be one of the instruments of setting up the kingdom of
        Daniel by the word of the Lord, and I intend to lay a foundation that
        will revolutionize the whole world. . . . It will not be by sword or gun
        that this kingdom will roll on: the power of truth is such that all
        nations will be under the necessity of obeying the Gospel.

          We consider that God has created man with a mind capable of
          instruction, and a faculty which may be enlarged in proportion to the
          heed and diligence given to the light communicated from heaven to the
          intellect; and that the nearer man approaches perfection, the clearer
          are his views, and the greater his enjoyments, till he has overcome
          the evils of his life and lost every desire for sin; and like the
          ancients, arrives at that point of faith where he is wrapped in the
          power and glory of his Maker, and is caught up to dwell with Him.
          -History of the Church, 2:8.

          I am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and
          the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by
          coming in contact with something else, striking with accelerated
          force against religious bigotry, priest-craft, lawyer-craft,
          doctor-craft, lying editors, suborned judges and jurors, and the
          authority of perjured executives, backed by mobs, blasphemers,
          licentious and corrupt men and women—all hell knocking off a corner
          here and a corner there. Thus I will become a smooth and polished
          shaft in the quiver of the Almighty.

          “Let us here observe, that a religion that does not require the
          sacrifice of all things, never has power sufficient to produce the
          faith necessary unto life and salvation.”

          A fanciful and flowery and heated imagination beware of; because the
          things of God are of deep import; and time, and experience, and careful
          and ponderous and solemn thoughts can only find them out. Thy mind, O
          man! if thou wilt lead a soul unto salvation, must stretch as high as
          the utmost heavens, and search into and contemplate the darkest abyss,
          and the broad expanse of eternity—thou must commune with God.
          -Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 137 (25 March 1839)
