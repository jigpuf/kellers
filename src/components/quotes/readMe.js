              <blockquote>
              I, Nephi, was desirous also that I might see, and hear, and know
              of these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift
              of God unto all those who diligently seek him, as well in times of
              old as in the time that he should manifest himself unto the
              children of men.  For he is the same yesterday, to-day, and
              forever; and the way is prepared for all men from the foundation
              of the world, if it so be that they repent and come unto him. For
              he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God
              shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as
              well in these times as in times of old as in times to come;
              wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal round.  Therefore
              remember, O man, for all thy doings thou shalt be brought into
              judgement. Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days
              of your probation, then ye are found unclean before the
              judgement-seat of God; and no unclean thing can dwell with God;
              wherefore, ye must be cast off forever.

                And blessed are they who shall seek to bring fourth my Zion at
                that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy
                Ghost; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up
                at the last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom
                of the Lamb; and whoso shall publish peace, yea, tidings of
                great joy, how beutiful upon the mountains shall they be.
