            Section 1:<br />
            Safety aspect on new site to consider- Area specific training<br />
            Just one more test and no support- stop, no buddy<br />
            Acceptable reasons to wave safety requirement- none<br />
            In hydrostatic testing, gas volume to consider- 5%<br />
            More potential energy - filled with gas<br />
            up to each engineer individual on type of test - false<br />
            Which scenarios not acceptable for safe opperating pressure - new MEOP on bench<br />
            PPE for indoor pressure test area - shoes, hearing, glasses<br /><br />

            Section 2:<br />
            Method to accept relief and orifice as sufficient- flowrate pressure calcs<br />
            Boom Box useage - latches engaged, rated for energy<br />
            Things to know about test article - Max op temp, fluid compatibility, strength struct. margins, max cycles<br />
            Each procedure starts with all valves - in safe position<br />
            When is cracking valve ok - never <br />
            When K-cap installed - bottle being moved, bottle not securely tethered<br />
            Steps to achieve safe state after testing - vent pressure from test, isolate at source<br />
            Key parts of engineering walkdown -trace all connections, physial examination of setup, inspect for damage <br />
            Don't see expected rise when adjusting regulator - stop and investigste setup<br /><br />

            Secttion 3:<br />
            Blast shields can replace boom box - false<br />
            Proper spacing of sand bags - 6 feet <br />
            Liquid Lock - trapping a liquid in a confined volume<br />
            Moisture not a problem - False<br />
            hazard of LN2 not present with LOX - Asphixiation<br />
            Hazard of LOX over LN2 - Reactivity<br />
            Cryogenic PPE purpose - cryogenic burns<br />
            Main Ox Valve incident - V-band clamp design not robust, inapropriate test pressure for v band<br />
            Center Pusher Incident - risk was unchanged<br />
            Stage 1 incident - compare names<br />
