      <h3>Mission Journal 1</h3>
      <h4>6:45 P.M. Waco, Texas 18 Nov 2001, Sunday</h4>
      <p>I hope to do justice to such a nice journal as this.  Shirley Farnsworth
      , the lady who gave this to me, obviously has a good amount of taste.  Her
      son Lynn went on a mission in Montana.<br />
      I grew up with this family, often spending 3 or 4 nights a week in their
      house durring my teenage years.  They are a good family though Steve is
      the only one that still goes to church.  Adam is the one my age and is one
      of my original paintball buddies.  He is also my oldest friend.</p>
      <h4>10:29 PM Provo, Utah MTC 19 Dec 2001, Wednesday</h4>
      <p>I'm Here.  The events leading to my arrival were nothing but good.  My
      farewell went very well, even though I officially became a crybaby.
      Sacrament went 25 minutes over since Mom and I couldn't seem to stop
      talking.  I was worried about making 10 minutes.  That night, 16 Dec 2001,
      I had amn open house.  Amber's grandmother gave me $50.  I guess that is
      bonus for doing her yardwork a couple of years ago.  The Paxtons who I
      didn't know before, gave me $50.  Bishop Johnson and Paul Romer both gave
      me $20.  John Stepp gave me $25.  Brother White gave me $25 along with a
      story about a Thanksgiving on hus mission when he ate noodles and
      said,"This Sucks!"  He said it was for the day when I would say the same
      thing.  He wanted me to eat really good when that day came which he
      assured me it would.<br />
      I pulled all the money from my account except for $1.  I was in the
      drive through just long enough for my car to run out of gas.<br />
      It wasn't until Tuesday 18 Dec 2001, that I was supposed to leave the
      airport.  The bishop told me it would be leaving at 9:24 AM.  I knew I was
      pushing it by arriving at 9:05, but realized I was really pushing it since
      the plane left at 9:04.  I caught the next plane to Dallas and then to
      Salt Lake.  I got to sit next to a kid from Nashville who couldn't have
      been more irritating.<br />
      Joe was at the airport waiting.  We left and visited Temple Square and the
      Conference Center.  The statue of Christ was amazing.  We went to the
      theater to watch The Testament and then went to Red Robins which gives
      free potato wedges.  I ate really good.  That night, last night, Joe and I
      went snow sledding in Provo until late.  At about 12:30 this afternoon, I
      checked into the MTC.<br />
      I have a companion named Stoker White.  He's a good guy.  I thought I was
      doing good by bringing $300 to the MTC, but the tenus and flu shots were
      $98.  Today was a whole lot of orientation but here is a quote,"What e'er
      thou art, act well thy part."</p>
      <h4>Words of Wisdom from Elder Matt Richardson:</h4>
      <p>
      I have devoted the next couple of pages to the strange things Elder
      Richardson, the companion of Elder Teeter, says.  He seems t have no end
      of these things.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>12-24-01: 3 out of 4 people make up 75% of the population.</li>
        <li>12-24-01: Elder Teeter: Disney World is the happiest place on
        Earth.  Elder Richardson: No, that's wrong-the temple is the happiest
        place on Earth...well maybe not the happiest, but definately the
        holiest.</li>
        <li>12-24-01: One time me and my brother were walking, and we saw a dead
        rat.  We named it Riggi...for rigimortis...get it?</li>
        <li>12-25-01: The gospel is like an orange.  You have to work for what
        you get.</li>
        <li>12-25-01:  One time these special people came to my church, and they
        were talking, and one guy said,"If life gives you a lemon make tang!"
        But they had down syndrom so they didn't know any better.</li>
        <li>12-25-01:  I wonder if someone didn't know anything about the
        church, and you sang 'How Great thou Art' if they would take it as a
        compliment.</li>
        <li>12-26-01:  You should get stale candy and take it to a hot climate
        and see how soft it gets.</li>
        <li>12-27-01:  Gifts from Grandma are like diapers, They are small and
        you don't like them.</li>
        <li>12-31-01:  If you want attention, don't pay your bills.</li>
        <li>12-31-01: It's like a parapalegic entitled to a foxtrot, you want it
        to happen,but... uh...forget it.</li>
        <li>1-7-02: I'm spontaneus, you never know what I will say or do.</li>
        <li>1-10-02:  Out of all the people I know, you are one of them.</li>
      </ul>
