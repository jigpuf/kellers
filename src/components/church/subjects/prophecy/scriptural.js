        will happen durring the sixth seal or 6 thousand years. The 144000 are
        sealed High Priests after the Holy Order of God. They are ordained out
        of every nation by the 4 angels to bring people to the church of the

        clothed with light, who will be full of truth who will set in order the
        house of God. He will arrange the lots of inheritance according to the

        Men's hearts will fail them. Angels will fly through heaven sounding
        the trump saying prepare ye, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet
        Him. This will imediately be followed by a great sign in heaven and the
        whole world will see it together. Another trump will sound and an angel
        will announce how the great and abominable church is bound and ready to
        be burned. He will sound his trump, and there will be silence in heaven

        will sound and the angel will announce that the lamb has overcome. The
        angels will be crowned with glory. They will recieve their inheritance
        and be made equal with Christ. 7 Trumpets will announce the acts of the
        7 thousand years and the binding of Satan for 1000 years.(84-110)
        </p>
        <p>
        90-The gospel will go first to the Gentiles and then to the Jews. Only
