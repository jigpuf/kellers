        1 Ne 10:6
        <p>
        And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil. And
        the law is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is justified; or, by
        the law men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal law they were cut off; and
        also, by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good, and become
        miserable forever.  Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy
        Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.  Behold, he offereth himself
        a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who
        have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the
        ends of the law be answered.  Wherefore, how great the importance to make
        these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know
        that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be
        through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who layeth
        down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power
        of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead,
        being the first that should rise.  Wherefore, he is the firstfruits unto
        God, inasmuch as he shall make intercession for all the children of men;
        and they that believe in him shall be saved.(2 Ne 2:5-9)

        “As the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt,
        and gave unto Moses power that he should heal the nations after they had
        been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast their eyes unto
        the serpent which he did raise up before them, and also gave him power
        that he should smite the rock and the water should come forth; yea,
        behold I say unto you, that as these things are true, and as the Lord
        God liveth, there is none other name given under heaven save it be this
        Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.” (2 Nephi 25:20)

        "And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and
        narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for
        ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken
        faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.
        Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having
        a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore,
        if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure
        to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.
        And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none
        other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the
        kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the
        only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
        Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen."(2 Ne 31:19-21)

        "And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of himself; but the
        sufferings and death of Christ atone for their sins, through faith and
        repentance, and so forth; and that he breaketh the bands of death, that
        the grave shall have no victory, and that the sting of death should be
        swallowed up in the hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound all these things
        unto the king."(Alma 22:14)"
