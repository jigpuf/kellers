        <h4>Conclusions:</h4>
        <li>The only begotten is the word of the Father's power</li>
        Moses 1
        <li>By the word of the Father's Power were the worlds created</li>
        Moses1
        <li>By the word of the Father's Power many worlds have passed away</li>
        Moses1
        <p>
          In Moses 4, it says Lucifer wanted the fathers power.  Either by the
          power of Christ Satan was cast out(as the punctuation suggests) or
          Lucifer wanted the power by the divine sunship if the semi-colon is taken
          away.
        </p>
        Moses 4
        <li>Under Satan's domininion, men seek power</li>
        Moses 6
        <p>After baptism, the thing which hath all power may be placed in you.
        It does not specify if this happens after sanctification or as part of
        it.</p>

        enoch</li>
        Moses 7
        <p>Christ Equates the priesthood with His name.  The priesthood refers
        becoming a High Priest after the same blessings of the Fathers.  After
        this, power would fall on him</p>
        Abraham 1
        <li>The planets hold keys of power or governing power</li>
        Fascimile 2
        <li>God is clothed with power and glory</li>
        Fascimile 2
        <li>The powers of heaven will be shaken. It is after this shaking that
        the sign of the son of man will be seen</li>

        JSH
        <li>Men had denied the power of godliness despite having a form of it,
        so there is power in Godliness</li>
        JSH
        <li>A priesthood power is laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy
        Ghost</li>
        JSH

        <h4>Other interesting things I learned in this study</h4>
        <p>Maybe the reason the eagles gather to the carcus as the sign, it may
        be talking about a gathering place that is full of dead peope because
        of war. JSM</p>
        <p>If Christ's name is equated with the holy priesthood as Abraham
        viewed it in the sense of becoming a high priest like the fathers, it
        seems that taking on the name of Christ in the sacrament prayer may be
        speaking of entrance into the holy order or the Patriarchal priestood
        of Celestial marriage</p>
