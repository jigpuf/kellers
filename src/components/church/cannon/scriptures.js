      <p>1-I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught
      somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions
      in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the
      Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and
      mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.

      <h4>1 Ne 2:16-17</h4>
      <p>16-And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young,
      nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to know
      of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold
      he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words
      which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him
      like unto my brothers.  17- And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him
      the things which the Lord had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit. And
      it came to pass that he believed in my words.
