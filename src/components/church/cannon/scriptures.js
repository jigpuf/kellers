          <p>1-I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught
          somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions
          in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the
          Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and
          mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.

        <h4>1 Ne 2:16-17</h4>
          <p>
            16-And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young,
            nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to know
            of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold
            he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words
            which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him
            like unto my brothers.  17- And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him
            the things which the Lord had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit. And
            it came to pass that he believed in my words.

        <h4>1 Ne 3:7</h4>
          <p>
            And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go
            and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the
            Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men. save he shall
            prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he 
            commandeth them.

          <p>1-And it shall come to pass, that if the Gentiles shall hearken
          unto the Lamb of God in that day that he shall manifest himself
          unto them in word, and also in power, in very deed, unto the
          taking away of their stumbling blocks-- 2-And harden not their hearts
          against the Lamb of God, they shall be numbered among the seed of thy
          father; yea, they shall be numbered among the house of Israel; and
          they shall be a blessed people upon the promised land forever; they
          shall be no more brought down into captivity; and the house of Israel
          shall no more be confounded. 3-And that great pit, which hath been
          digged for them by that great and abominable church, which was founded
          by the devil and his children, that he might lead away the souls of
          men down to hell--yea, that great pit which hath been digged for the
          destruction of men shall be filled by those who digged it, unto their
          utter destruction, saith the Lamb of God; not the destruction of the
          soul, save it be the casting of it into that hell which hath no end.
          7-For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work a
          great and a marvelous work among the children of men; a work which
          shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the other--either
          to the convincing of them unto peace and life eternal, or unto the
          deliverance of them to the hardness of their hearts and the blindness
          of their minds unto their being brought down into captivity, and also
          into destruction, both temporally and spiritually, according to the
          captivity of the devil, of which I have spoken.</p>
