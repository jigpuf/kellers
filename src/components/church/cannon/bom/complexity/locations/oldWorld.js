        <h3>The Old World</h3>
        <p>
        The First 7 chapters of the Book of Mormon deal with the back and forth
        between Lehi's family in the wilderness and Jerusalem. Chapters 8-16 all
        take place in the valley of Lemuel.  In Chapter 16, they recieve
        instructions to leave the Valley and begin their trek through  Nahom,
        Shazer, and eventually to Bountiful and Irreantum, where they will leave
        the old World.
        </p>
        <p>
        The first 7 chapters have the following Locations: Jerusalem, the land
        of Jerusalem, The Borders near the red sea, The wilderness in the Borders
        nearer the Red Sea, The land of Lehi's inheritance, the Valey of Lemuel,
        and the River of Laman that goes to the Fountain of the Red Sea.
        Also the houses of Lehi, Laban, and Ishmael.
        </p>
        <h4>The land of Jerusalem</h4>
        1 Ne 1-5, 7(600 - 592 BC)<br />
        <h5>Lehi's House and land of inheritance</h5>
        1 Ne 1-3<br />
        <p>
        The Land of Jerusalem obviously surounds the city of Jerusalem, though
        it is impossible from the text to tell how far.  Lehi lived "at" Jerusalem
        all his days which may imply that he lived outside of the city proper.
        Possibly in a suburb.(1 Ne 1:4)  In the first Year of the reign of Zedekiah, Lehi
        already had 4 boys and probably some number of daughters. Nephi, the
        youngest was already old enough to travel alone into the city in chapter
        3, but young enough to have three older, unmarried brothers.  This would
        make sense for Nephi and his brothers to be teenaged since marrying as a
        teen would have been common for the time.  Since Lehi's own house is said
        to be "at" Jerusalem, some of the elements of the story may feel a bit
        different in the exchange between Laban and his sons.  It was at Lehi's
        house where he would have his second vision and his throne theophony.
        While in vision, he read a heavenly book and prophecied the Babylonian
        captivity.(1 Ne 1:7-13)  After the vision in his house, Lehi went forth preaching to
        the Jews, though it is not clear if he went into Jerusalem to preach.
        It is probably in his house where he has his third vision where he is
        told to take his family into the wilderness.  The text says he left "His
        house, and the land of his inheritance... and his precious things".(1 Ne 2:1-4)  So
        the land of Lehi's inheritance seems like it is in the Land of Jerusalem
        since he leaves it when he leaves his house where people want to kill
        him, which is probably near where he was preaching.  From there, he
        traveled down to the borders near the red sea.  His sons would later
        come back to this house durring their first trip back to Jerusalem to
        take all the precious things they left behind to exchange them with
        Laban for the brass plates.  That will be the last time they see their
        house in the text.(1 Ne 3:22-23)
        </p>
        <h5>Laban's House</h5>
        1 Ne 3-4<br />
        <p>
        Laban's house seems to be in Jerusalem.  It is the first time the story
        specifically goes into the city itself.  It may have happened before, but
        the text was not explicit.  While Nephi and his brother's, in chapter 3,
        first go up to the land of Jerusalem, Laban's house would be in Jerusalem,
        in the Land of Jerusalem.(1 Ne 3:9-11)  Since the first attempt with Laban fails at
        obtaining the brass plates, Nephi suggest that they go down to the land
        of their inheritance to get their possessions.  They then go back up to
        Laban's house.( 1 Ne 3:16-23)  This suggest that the land of Lehi's inheritance and
        house are inside of the land of Jerusalem but possibly down in topography.
        On the second attempt Laban stole their belongings and his servants
        chased the 4 boys away.  I wonder if Zoram was one of these servants.(1Ne 3:24-27)
        After this event Laban went out among the Elders of Judah to do whatever
        they do. The result is he wound up drunk and under the power of Nephi.
        Nephi had to sneak back into the city this time.  After killing Laban
        and taking his clothing, Nephi found zoram and got into the treasury of
        Laban.  From there, he was able to get the brass plates out of Jerusalem
        and took Zoram with him.(1 Ne 4)
        </p>
        <h5>Ishmael's House</h5>
        1 Ne 7<br />
        <p>
        The final trip up to the land of Jerusalem and to Jerusalem would lead to the
        house of Ishmael.  Here it actually uses the term "we" spoke unto him
        the words of the Lord, which means Laman and Lemuel may have been on
        their best behavior.  Ishmael's entire family leaves and this will
        be the last time anyone from these two families will ever see Jerusalem,
        the land of Jerusalem, or the lands of their inheritance.(1 Ne 7:1-5)  Though
        Jerusalem is refered to for the wikidness of it's people and the comming
        of Christ, it will not enter the timeline of anyone in the Book of
        Mormon again, with the exception of Christ.  The Baylonians will come.
        They will destroy the city. They will enslave the people.  After the
        Jews return from Persia, they will re-establish Jerusalem, rebuild the
        temple, and crucify Jesus.
