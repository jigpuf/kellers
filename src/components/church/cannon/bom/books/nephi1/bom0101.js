          <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Introduction of Self and Text:</li>
              <p>
              Nephi had good parents, and he recieved somewhat in all the
              knowledge of his father.  He considers himself highly
              favored of the Lord despite having seen many afflictions.  He has
              recieved a lot of the mysteries and seen a lot of the good of God.
              The record he is making is in the language of his father.  His
              father's language consist of the language of the Egyptians and the
              learning of the Jews. He proclaims it to be true and according to
              his knowledge.(v1-3)
              </p>
            <li>State of Jerusalem:</li>
              <p>Zedekiah has just become king.  He has followed a series of
              kings in short succession.  He is considering turning against
              Babylon and siding with the Egyptians.  Jeremiah is warning
              against the action and many prophets are prophesying of its
              destruction.(v4)</p>
            <li>Lehi's first vision:</li>
              <p>Lehi, while praying for his people, recieved his first vision.
              In the vision, a pillar of fire comes down onto a rock in front of
              him and dwells there.  It doesn't tell what he saw, but it made
              him tremble and seemingly weakened him enough that he went home
              to go to bed.(5-7)</p>
            <li>Lehi's second vision:</li>
              <p>Once home he has a second vision of God on His throne.  He saw
              the angels in continuous circles around God praising Him. One very
              bright one left heaven followed by 12 others.  It does not say who
              they are, but maybe it is Christ.  Maybe it is the 12 apostles
              from Jerusalem, but maybe the 12 from the Nephites.  They go out
              on the earth, but the first and brightest one goes to Lehi and
              gives him a book to read. The book discussed the wikidness and
              eventual destruction of Jerusalem. He saw them carried into Babylon.
              From this experience, Lehi is led to glorify God and be thankful
              for His mercy.  He saw something about salvation for the righteous, because he
              mentions that God will not allow those who come to God to perrish.
              It probably is discussing this on a spiritual level since many come
              to God in the Book of Mormon and die anyway.  We find out later in
              the chapter that he learned about the comming of the Messiah and
              the redemption of the world(v8-15)</p>
            <li>Nephi discusses records</li>
              <p>Nephi won't write everything about his father.  There are many
              more teachings from Lehi.  Nephi will abridge the record of his
              father and then continue on to his own life.(v.16-17)</p>
            <li>Lehi prophesies to people:</li>
              <p>Lehi shares his prophecies with the Jews.  He told them about
              their wikidness, their comming destruction.  He told them of the
              comming of the Messiah and the redemption of the world.  For that,
              they wanted to kill him.(v.18-20)</p>
            <li>Promise of preservation:</li>
              <p>Nephi discusses the power of deliverence.  People are chosen
              because of their faith.  The tender mercies of the Lord are over
              them once chosen.  Those mercies can extend even into that power
              of deliverance.  I think he is speaking in the physical sense here
              since the next chapter is about them being given warning to save
              their lives.(v.20)</p>

              <p>The religion has gone over into the Deuteronomists reformation.
              They don't trust angels, they don't trust visions, they kill false
              prophets and believe Jerusalem cannot be destroyed.  This religion
              seems to be lived by Laman and Lemuel.  It explains all their
              actions.  Sariah seems to be in it also since she complains about
              Lehi being a visionary man.</p>

          <h3>Major Points to consider</h3>
            <li>Parenting</li>
              <p>Nephi at a minimum relates his learning as an extension of the
              good parents.(v.1)</p>
            <li>Records</li>
              <p>Nephi only does an abridgement of his fathers writings. Since
              we lost the writings of the Book of Lehi, it is good that Nephi
              gave us what he did.(v.16-17)</p>
            <li>Power of Deliverence</li>
              <p>Lehi first gives a clue into the concepts of the power of
              deliverence in verse 14 after recieving his vision.  Nephi is
              looking back from many years later and uses this opportunity to
              both explain the requirements of this power and to use wht happens
              next in the story to show an example of it. Lehi explains that
              God's mercy will not allow those who come to Him to perrish.
              Lehi is discussing the spiritual deliverence since there are many
              who die physically despite comming to God.  Nephi amplifies the
              teaching.  Nephi explains that mercy comes from being chosen.
              Being chosen comes from faith.  After the faith comes being made
              mighty.  Possibly that might will extend into the power of
              deliverence which Nephi shows in physical terms.  I think what
              this is saying is that the power of deliverence is the ultimate
              level of God's mercy extending into your physical existence and
              not just into the future resurection and salvation.  In D&C we
              learn that people are not chosen because their hearts are set on
              the things of the world and they aspire to the honors of man.
              They also are seeking power over men or dominion over them.
              This is sounding awfully close to the desires of the devil's
              church being possessions, popularity, power, and lusts of the
              flesh.  The power discussed in 121 is power in the priesthood.
              This leads me to believe that the power of deliverence may extend
              from the powers of the priesthood.  So, it seems that we are
              chosen by faith, but we will not be chosen if our hearts are set
              on the desires of the church of the devil.  If we can avoid that,
              then we are give power in the priesthood.  One of the powers of
              the priesthood is the power of deliverence.  It is first given as
              a means of overcoming the first and second death and is provided
              by Christ.  Is we are faithful, the mercy of God is undeniable.
              The power of deliverence can then extend into the mortal life of
              the holder of the power and looks a lot like being told what to do
              to avoid death like the children of Israel, or even in terms of
              protection in the creation of fear on enemies like the city of
              Enoch and the eventual establishment of Zion.(v.14,20)</p>

          <h3>Technology</h3>
            Literacy, Learning of the Jews, Language of the Egyptians
            <hr />
          <h3>Questions</h3>
            <li>Lehi's Language</li>
             <p>Nephi describes the language of his father as the learning of the
             Jews and the language of the Egyptians.  Does this mean Lehi's
             language was Egyptian or perhaps just his written language?</p>
            <li>Angel visitation</li>
             <p>When the 13 figures come down in the second vision, it says they
             went forth on the earth.  Does this mean they all went to different
             places, possibly with different people, but Lehi got the most
             important angel?  Is there any way to tell if they are Christ and
             apostles?</p>
            <li>Records</li>
              <p>What can we know about Lehi's record?  When was this written?
              What is the flow of this record into the final txt of the golden
              plates?  Was this on the beginning or the end on the gold plates?</p>
              <p></p>
