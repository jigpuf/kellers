          <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Introduction of Self and Text:</li>
              <p>
              Nephi had good parents, and he recieved somewhat in all the
              knowledge of his father.  He considers himself highly
              favored of the Lord despite having seen many afflictions.  He has
              recieved a lot of the mysteries and seen a lot of the good of God.
              The record he is making is in the language of his father.  His
              father's language consist of the language of the Egyptians and the
              learning of the Jews. He proclaims it to be true and according to
              his knowledge.(v.1-3)
              </p>
            <li>State of Jerusalem:</li>
              <p>
              Zedekiah has recently become king.  Jerusalem has many prophets
              prophecying of its destruction(v.4)
              </p>
            <li>Lehi's first vision:</li>
              <p>
              Lehi was on his way somewhere and decided to pray for his people.
              A pillar of fire dwelt on a rock and Lehi saw and heard things
              that made him tremble(v.5-6)
              </p>
            <li>Lehi's second vision:</li>
              <p>
              Lehi went home which was located at Jerusalem.  He was then
              carried away into a vision.  In the vision, he saw, in the heavens,
              what he believed to be God on His throne. There were continuous
              circles of angels around His throne praising Him. One angel
              descended out of heaven.  He shined brighter than the sun at noon.
              The angel was followed by 12 other angels that shined less, but
              still like the stars.  The angels went onto the face of the Earth.
              The first angel stood in front of Lehi and handed him a book and
              told him to read it. The reading of the book caused Lehi to be
              filled with the spirit.  He read about the evil of Jerusalem and
              its comming destruction at the hands of Babylon.  He read and saw
              many things.  He then began praising God and His mercy and
              protection of those who come to Him.(v.7-15)
              </p>
            <li>Description of plates</li>
              <p>
              Nephi is not making a full account of Lehi's life and writings.
              There are many other prophecies in the writings of Lehi. Nephi is
              making a record of his own life and actions.  There is only an
              abridgement of Lehi's record here.(v.16-17)
              </p>
            <li>Lehi prophesies to people:</li>
              <p>
              Lehi went among the people prophecying about the things he saw in
              his vision. The Jews made fun of Lehi because he testified of
              their wickedness and a comming Messiah(v.18-19)
              </p>
            <li>Promise of preservation:</li>
              <p>
              The Jews got angry with him. God will have mercy on those He has
              chosen because of their faith. That mercy could even extend to
              deliverence.(v.20)
              </p>

               While they still have the first temple, they are post
               Deuteronomist Reformation.  The tribes of the North hve been
               scattered among the Southern tribes for about 100 years.
               Jerusalem is a city of some prominance.  The old and new
               theologies are competing and the Rabbi's are challenging the
               priesthood for athority.  There are competing prophecies between
               true and false prophets.
