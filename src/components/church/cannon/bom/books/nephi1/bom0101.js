          <h3>Synopsis</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Introduction of Self and Text:</li>
              <p>
              Nephi had good parents, and he recieved somewhat in all the
              knowledge of his father.  He considers himself highly
              favored of the Lord despite having seen many afflictions.  He has
              recieved a lot of the mysteries and seen a lot of the good of God.
              The record he is making is in the language of his father.  His
              father's language consist of the language of the Egyptians and the
              learning of the Jews. He proclaims it to be true and according to
              his knowledge.(v1-3)
              </p>
            <li>State of Jerusalem:</li>
              <p>Zedekiah has just become king.  He has followed a series of
              kings in short succession.  He is considering turning against
              Babylon and siding with the Egyptians.  Jeremiah is warning
              against the action and many prophets are prophesying of its
              destruction.(v4)</p>
            <li>Lehi's first vision:</li>
              <p>Lehi, while praying for his people, recieved his first vision.
              In the vision, a pillar of fire comes down onto a rock in front of
              him and dwells there.  It doesn't tell what he saw, but it made
              him tremble and seemingly weakened him enough that he went home
              to go to bed.(5-7)</p>
            <li>Lehi's second vision:</li>
              <p>Once home he has a second vision of God on His throne.  He saw
              the angels in continuous circles around God praising Him. One very
              bright one left heaven followed by 12 others.  It does not say who
              they are, but maybe it is Christ.  Maybe it is the 12 apostles
              from Jerusalem, but maybe the 12 from the Nephites.  They go out
              on the earth, but the first and brightest one goes to Lehi and
              gives him a book to read. The book discussed the wikidness and
              eventual destruction of Jerusalem. He saw them carried into Babylon.
              From this experience, Lehi is led to glorify God and be thankful
              for His mercy.  He saw something about salvation for the righteous, because he
              mentions that God will not allow those who come to God to perrish.
              It probably is discussing this on a spiritual level since many come
              to God in the Book of Mormon and die anyway.  We find out later in
              the chapter that he learned about the comming of the Messiah and
              the redemption of the world(v8-15)</p>
            <li>Nephi discusses records</li>
              <p>Nephi won't write everything about his father.  There are many
              more teachings from Lehi.  Nephi will abridge the record of his
              father and then continue on to his own life.(v.16-17)</p>
            <li>Lehi prophesies to people:</li>
              <p>Lehi shares his prophecies with the Jews.  He told them about
              their wikidness, their comming destruction.  He told them of the
              comming of the Messiah and the redemption of the world.  For that,
              they wanted to kill him.(v.18-20)</p>
            <li>Promise of preservation:</li>
              <p>Nephi discusses the power of deliverence.  People are chosen
              because of their faith.  The tender mercies of the Lord are over
              them once chosen.  Those mercies can extend even into that power
              of deliverance.  I think he is speaking in the physical sense here
              since the next chapter is about them being given warning to save
              their lives.(v.20)</p>

              <p>The religion has gone over into the Deuteronomists reformation.
              They don't trust angels, they don't trust visions, they kill false
              prophets and believe Jerusalem cannot be destroyed.  This religion
              seems to be lived by Laman and Lemuel.  It explains all their
              actions.  Sariah seems to be in it also since she complains about
              Lehi being a visionary man.</p>

          <h3>Major Points to consider</h3>
            <li>Parenting</li>
              <p>Nephi at a minimum relates his learning as an extension of the
              good parents.(v.1)</p>
            <li>Records</li>
              <p>Nephi only does an abridgement of his fathers writings. Since
              we lost the writings of the Book of Lehi, it is good that Nephi
              gave us what he did.(v.16-17)</p>
            <li>Power of Deliverence</li>
              <p>Lehi first gives a clue into the concepts of the power of
              deliverence in verse 14 after recieving his vision.  Nephi is
              looking back from many years later and uses this opportunity to
              both explain the requirements of this power and to use wht happens
              next in the story to show an example of it. Lehi explains that
              God's mercy will not allow those who come to Him to perrish.
              Lehi is discussing the spiritual deliverence since there are many
              who die physically despite comming to God.  Nephi amplifies the
              teaching.  Nephi explains that mercy comes from being chosen.
              Being chosen comes from faith.  After the faith comes being made
              mighty.  Possibly that might will extend into the power of
              deliverence which Nephi shows in physical terms.  I think what
              this is saying is that the power of deliverence is the ultimate
              level of God's mercy extending into your physical existence and
              not just into the future resurection and salvation.  In D&C we
              learn that people are not chosen because their hearts are set on
              the things of the world and they aspire to the honors of man.
              They also are seeking power over men or dominion over them.
              This is sounding awfully close to the desires of the devil's
              church being possessions, popularity, power, and lusts of the
              flesh.  The power discussed in 121 is power in the priesthood.
              This leads me to believe that the power of deliverence may extend
              from the powers of the priesthood.  So, it seems that we are
              chosen by faith, but we will not be chosen if our hearts are set
              on the desires of the church of the devil.  If we can avoid that,
              then we are give power in the priesthood.  One of the powers of
              the priesthood is the power of deliverence.  It is first given as
              a means of overcoming the first and second death and is provided
              by Christ.  Is we are faithful, the mercy of God is undeniable.
              The power of deliverence can then extend into the mortal life of
              the holder of the power and looks a lot like being told what to do
              to avoid death like the children of Israel, or even in terms of
              protection in the creation of fear on enemies like the city of
              Enoch and the eventual establishment of Zion.(v.14,20)</p>

            Literacy, Learning of the Jews, Language of the Egyptians
            <hr />
          <h3>Questions</h3>
            <li>Lehi's Language</li>
             <p>Nephi describes the language of his father as the learning of the
             Jews and the language of the Egyptians.  Does this mean Lehi's
             language was Egyptian or perhaps just his written language?</p>
            <li>Angel visitation</li>
             <p>When the 13 figures come down in the second vision, it says they
             went forth on the earth.  Does this mean they all went to different
             places, possibly with different people, but Lehi got the most
             important angel?  Is there any way to tell if they are Christ and
             apostles?</p>
            <li>Records</li>
              <p>What can we know about Lehi's record?  When was this written?
              What is the flow of this record into the final txt of the golden
              plates?  Was this on the beginning or the end on the gold plates?</p>

            being called, (beginning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and
            Nephi. The Lord warns Lehi to depart out of the land of Jerusalem,
            because he prophesieth unto the people concerning their iniquity and
            they seek to destroy his life. He taketh three days' journey into
            the wilderness with his family. Nephi taketh his brethren and
            returneth to the land of Jerusalem after the record of the Jews. The
            account of their sufferings. They take the daughters of Ishmael to
            wife. They take their families and depart into the wilderness. Their
            sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness. The course of their
            travels. They come to the large waters. Nephi's brethren rebel
            against him. He confoundeth them, and buildeth a ship. They call the
            name of the place Bountiful. They cross the large waters into the
            promised land, and so forth. This is according to the account of
            Nephi; or in other words, I, Nephi, wrote this record.

            NE1 1:2 Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:3 And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:4 For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my father, Lehi, having dwelt at Jerusalem in all his days); and in that same year there came many prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:5 Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:6 And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:7 And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the things which he had seen.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:8 And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, and he thought he saw God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising their God.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:9 And it came to pass that he saw One descending out of the midst of heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of the sun at noon-day.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:10 And he also saw twelve others following him, and their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the firmament.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:11 And they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth; and the first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him a book, and bade him that he should read.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:12 And it came to pass that as he read, he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:13 And he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen thine abominations! Yea, and many things did my father read concerning Jerusalem--that it should be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof; many should perish by the sword, and many should be carried away captive into Babylon.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:14 And it came to pass that when my father had read and seen many great and marvelous things, he did exclaim many things unto the Lord; such as: Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth; and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall perish!
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:15 And after this manner was the language of my father in the praising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because of the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord had shown unto him.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:16 And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things which my father hath written, for he hath written many things which he saw in visions and in dreams; and he also hath written many things which he prophesied and spake unto his children, of which I shall not make a full account.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:17 But I shall make an account of my proceedings in my days. Behold, I make an abridgment of the record of my father, upon plates which I have made with mine own hands; wherefore, after I have abridged the record of my father then will I make an account of mine own life.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:18 Therefore, I would that ye should know, that after the Lord had shown so many marvelous things unto my father, Lehi, yea, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, behold he went forth among the people, and began to prophesy and to declare unto them concerning the things which he had both seen and heard.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:19 And it came to pass that the Jews did mock him because of the things which he testified of them; for he truly testified of their wickedness and their abominations; and he testified that the things which he saw and heard, and also the things which he read in the book, manifested plainly of the coming of a Messiah, and also the redemption of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
            NE1 1:20 And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with him; yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast out, and stoned, and slain; and they also sought his life, that they might take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.<br />
