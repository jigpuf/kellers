      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <div class='twoColumn'>

        The Book of Mormon is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the
        Bible. It is a record of God’s dealings with ancient inhabitants of the
        Americas and contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel.<br />
        The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy
        and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and
        abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an
        account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C.
        and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the
        Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the
        tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites.
        After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and
        they are among the ancestors of the American Indians.<br />
        The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal
        ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after His
        resurrection.<br />

        <ol>
          <li><mark>It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel</mark></li>
          <li><mark>outlines the plan of salvation</mark></li>
          <li><mark>tells men what they must do to gain peace in this
          life and eternal salvation in the life to come.</mark></li>
        </ol>

        After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son
        Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the
        Hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glorified,
        resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed
        him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the
        English language.<br />
        In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated
        them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many
        languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son
        of the living God and that all who will come unto Him and obey the laws
        and ordinances of His gospel may be saved.<br />
        Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: “I told the
        brethren that the Book of Mormon was <mark>the most correct of any book on
        earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to
        God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.”</mark><br />
        In addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to see
        the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth
        and divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are
        included herewith as “The Testimony of Three Witnesses” and “The
        Testimony of Eight Witnesses.”<br />
        We invite all men everywhere to:<br />
        <ol>
          <li><mark>read the Book of Mormon</mark></li>
          <li><mark>ponder in their hearts the message it contains</mark></li>
          <li><mark>ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ if the book is
          true.</mark></li>
          Those who pursue this course and ask in faith will:
          <li><mark>gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by the power of the Holy
          Ghost. (See Moroni 10:3–5.)</mark></li>
        </ol>
        Those who gain this divine witness from the Holy Spirit will also come
        to know by the same power that:
        <ol>
          <li><mark>Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world</mark></li>
          <li><mark>Joseph Smith is His revelator and prophet in these last days</mark></li>
          <li><mark>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord’s
          kingdom once again established on the earth, preparatory to the Second
          Coming of the Messiah.</mark></li>

      THE BOOK OF MORMON AN ACCOUNT WRITTEN BY THE HAND OF MORMON UPON PLATES
      TAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI<br />
      Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and
      also of the Lamanites—Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the
      house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile—Written by way of commandment,
      and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation—Written and sealed up,
      and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed—To come forth
      by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof—Sealed by the
      hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by way
      of the Gentile—The interpretation thereof by the gift of God.<br />
      An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of the
      people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the
      language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to
      heaven—Which is to <mark>show unto the remnant of the house of Israel</mark><br />
      <ol>
        <li><mark>what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers</mark></li>
        <li><mark>that they may know the covenants of the Lord</mark></li>
        <li><mark>that they are not cast off forever</mark></li>
      </ol>
      —And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that:
      <ol>
        <li><mark>Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all
        nations</mark></li>
      </ol>
      —And now, if there are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore,
      condemn not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the
      judgment-seat of Christ.<br />

      <h3>Keystone:</h3>
        <p>Joseph Smith Said,“I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was
        the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our
        religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its
        precepts, than by any other book”</p>
        <p>To understand this statement, we need to ask:</p>
        <li>1)What is meant by "our religion"?</li>
        <li>2)What a keystone does in architecture?</li>
        <li>3)How that relationship of a keystone to the arch applies to the
        Book of Mormon in our religion?</li>

        <h4>Our Religion</h4>
          <p>Joseph Smith described our religion as follows:</p>
          <p>The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the
          Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was
          buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all
          other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.
          Truth is "Mormonism."</p>
          <p>We see the fundamental principles that make up the religion as the
          mission and success of Christ.  This extends into all truth.  Brigham
          Young had a lot to say on this. This leads us to ask what is truth in
          the same way Pilot asked Christ thaat same question(John 18:37-38).
          Here we refer to a few scriptures:</p>
          <p>D&C 84:45-47</p>
          <p>For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light,
          and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ.  And
          the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the
          Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the
          voice of the Spirit.  And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the
          Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.  And the Father teacheth him
          of the covenant which he has renewed and confirmed upon you, which is
          confirmed upon you for your sakes, and not for your sakes only, but for
          the sake of the whole world.</p>
          <p>D&C 93:24,30,36</p>
          <p>And truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and
          as they are to come;...All truth is independent in that sphere in which
          God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also;
          otherwise there is no existence...The glory of God is intelligence, or,
          in other words, light and truth.</p>
          <p>John 17:17-19</p>
          <p>Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.  As thou hast sent
          me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. And for
          their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified
          through the truth.</p>
          <p>1 John 5:6</p>
          <p>This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by
          water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth
          witness, because the Spirit is truth.</p>
          <p>D&C 88:66-68</p>
          <p>Behold, that which you hear is as the voice of one crying in the
          wilderness—in the wilderness, because you cannot see him—my voice,
          because my voice is Spirit; my Spirit is truth; truth bideth and hath no
          end; and if it be in you it shall abound. And if your eye be single to
          my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall
          be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light
          comprehendeth all things. Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds
          become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him; for
          he will unveil his face unto you, and it shall be in his own time, and
          in his own way, and according to his own will.</p>
          <p>The equivalences drawn here are as follows:</p>
          <li>1) The word of the Lord is either the same or a sub-category of
          Truth</li>
          <li>2) Truth is either the same or a sub-category of light</li>
          <li>3) Light is either the same or a sub-category of spirit(the spirit
          of Jesus Christ)</li>
          <li>4) Light and truth make up inetelligence or are equivalent to it.</li>
          <li>5) Truth is the knowledge of things as they are, were, and will be</li>
          <li>6) The glory of God is intelligence and therefore light and truth.</li>
        <h4>The Keystone Purpose</h4>
          <p>The arch cannot support weight until the keystone is added.</p>
          <p>The Keystone is longer and allows the differing arches to come to a
          point that makes up the differences.  This allows the  incongruence to
          find its commonality.</p>
        <h4>The Relationship</h4>
          <p> Other aspects of our religion can only hold weight if the Book of Mormon is
          a true document.  Keystone because if we can show the Book of Mormon
          to be true, then the claims of Joseph's status as a prophet and
          reality of the priesthood authority will be able to bear scrutiny.
          The life the book causes a person to live is further power to the
          support of the arch of truth.  As a man gets nearer to God, he gets
          better.  People will see this and it gives power to the argument of
          the religion's validity.  It also allows the imperfections built into
          the Bible and into the Christian tradition to play nice in a way that
          squashes doubts.  We no longer need the creedal systems.  We instead
          rely on revealed truth</p>
