        <h3>Keystone:</h3>
        <p>Joseph Smith Said,“I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was
        the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our
        religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its
        precepts, than by any other book”</p>
        <p>To understand this statement, we need to ask:</p>
        <li>1)What is meant by "our religion"?</li>
        <li>2)What a keystone does in architecture?</li>
        <li>3)How that relationship of a keystone to the arch applies to the
        Book of Mormon in our religion?</li>
        <h4>Our Religion</h4>
          <p>Joseph Smith described our religion as follows:</p>
          <p>The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the
          Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was
          buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all
          other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.
          Truth is "Mormonism."</p>
          <p>We see the fundamental principles that make up the religion as the
          mission and success of Christ.  This extends into all truth.  Brigham
          Young had a lot to say on this. This leads us to ask what is truth in
          the same way Pilot asked Christ thaat same question(John 18:37-38).
          Here we refer to a few scriptures:</p>
          <p>D&C 84:45-47</p>
          <p>For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light,
          and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ.  And
          the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the
          Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the
          voice of the Spirit.  And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the
          Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.  And the Father teacheth him
          of the covenant which he has renewed and confirmed upon you, which is
          confirmed upon you for your sakes, and not for your sakes only, but for
          the sake of the whole world.</p>
          <p>D&C 93:24,30,36</p>
          <p>And truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and
          as they are to come;...All truth is independent in that sphere in which
          God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also;
          otherwise there is no existence...The glory of God is intelligence, or,
          in other words, light and truth.</p>
          <p>John 17:17-19</p>
          <p>Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.  As thou hast sent
          me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. And for
          their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified
          through the truth.</p>
          <p>1 John 5:6</p>
          <p>This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by
          water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth
          witness, because the Spirit is truth.</p>
          <p>D&C 88:66-68</p>
          <p>Behold, that which you hear is as the voice of one crying in the
          wilderness—in the wilderness, because you cannot see him—my voice,
          because my voice is Spirit; my Spirit is truth; truth bideth and hath no
          end; and if it be in you it shall abound. And if your eye be single to
          my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall
          be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light
          comprehendeth all things. Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds
          become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him; for
          he will unveil his face unto you, and it shall be in his own time, and
          in his own way, and according to his own will.</p>
          <p>The equivalences drawn here are as follows:</p>
          <li>1) The word of the Lord is either the same or a sub-category of
          Truth</li>
          <li>2) Truth is either the same or a sub-category of light</li>
          <li>3) Light is either the same or a sub-category of spirit(the spirit
          of Jesus Christ)</li>
          <li>4) Light and truth make up inetelligence or are equivalent to it.</li>
          <li>5) Truth is the knowledge of things as they are, were, and will be</li>
          <li>6) The glory of God is intelligence and therefore light and truth.</li>
        <h4>The Keystone Purpose</h4>
          <p>The arch cannot support weight until the keystone is added.</p>
        <h4>The Relationship</h4>
          <p> Other aspects of our religion can only hold weight if the Book of Mormon is
          a true document.  Keystone because if we can show the Book of Mormon
          to be true, then the claims of Joseph's status as a prophet and
          reality of the priesthood authority will be able to bear scrutiny.
          The life the book causes a person to live is further power to the
          support of the arch of truth.  As a man gets nearer to God, he gets
          better.  People will see this and it gives power to the argument of
          the religion's validity.</p>
