          <li>If man is concieved in sin(moses 6:55), and Christ wasn't (luke 1:5-6, Alma 7:10), why couldn't we all
          have been concieved not in sin?  What does Christ miss out on not
          being concieved in sin?He definately suffered temptations(Alma 7:11, moses 3:7, Mosiah 15:5, D&C 20:22) but gave no
          heed.  How did he suffer temptation without the corruption?  Is it the
          same way Adam did?Or is suffer meant in the way 1 Cor 10:13 meaning
          he allowed temptation?  Maybe Christ had a greater capacity for
          suffering.  Maybe we would have not allowed the suffering and
          therefore not been glorified by it. 3 Ne 18:25 gives insight into a
          man suffering himself to be led into temptation.  What are the
          differences between suffering temptation and suffering yourself to be
          led into temptation?Why does the Lord's prayer ask to lead us not into
          tempteation.  Would God do that?What are the ways to enter into
          temptation and not enter(Alma 31:10, Luke 11:4, 22:46; 3 Ne18:18&25)</li>
          <li>If a person believes in Darwinism, how do you square that with the
          lack of death before the fall(2 Ne 2:22, Moses 6:48)? Was there
          progression without death?  Was the fall billions of years?</li>
          <li>Why is death required for sorrow?(D&C 101:29, Matt 26:38, Rev 21:4, Alma 28:14, 3 Ne 28:9&28)What does
          that mean when we say Christ bore our sorrows(Isaiah 53:3-4)?
          Mark 13:8 associates natural disasters with the beginning of sorrows.
          There are different types of sorrows that lead to life and death
          (2 Cor 7:9-11) Alma 40:12 that righteous are recieved into a state
          without suffering after death </li>
