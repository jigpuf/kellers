      somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions
      in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the
      Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and
      mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.
