        5-A desolating scourge(sickness) will not stop<br />
        until the coming of the savior(18,19)<br /><br />
        45-Remnant will remain scattered until the time<br />
        of the Gentiles is fulfilled.  There will be wars<br />
        and rumors of wars.The earth will be in commotion.<br />
        Men's hearts will fail them.  They will claim<br />
        delays His comming.  The love of men will wax<br />
        cold. Evil will be everywhere.  The gospel in<br />
        its fulness will be brought forth at the<br />
        beginning of the time of the gentiles.  The <br />
        desolating scourge will happen and cover the<br />
        land.  The saints will stand in holy places<br />
        of protection.  There will be earthquakes and<br />
        war.The sign of the comming of the son of man,<br />
        blood, fire, and vapor of smoke.  There will<br />
        be wonders in heaven and in the earth.  The<br />
        sun will be darkened and the moon turned to<br />
        blood.  Stars will fall from heaven. The <br />
        remnant will be gathered to Jerusalen and see<br />
        Christ return in a cloud of glory with all His<br />
        angels.  Before the arm of the Lord falls, an<br />
        angel will sound his trump, and the saints<br />
        to meet Christ in the sky.After that, the <br />
        arm of the Lord falls on the nations.  Then,<br />
        Christ will step on the Mount of Olives<br />
        breaking it in half.  The earth and<br />
        heavens will shake and the Earth will real<br />
        to and fro.  The Lords voice shall be heard<br />
        across the entir Earth.  The wickid will be<br />
        destroyed.  The Jews wil see Christ and accept<br />
        Him.  There will then be a resurection of the<br />
        heathen nations and Satan is bound.(24-57)<br />
        The New Jerusalem in Missouri, will be a place<br />
        of refuge and Safety for the saints.  The wickid<br />
        will not come to Jerusalem.  The terror of the<br />
        the Lord will be there.  It will be called Zion.<br />
        If any man doesn't want to fight in the chaos, he<br />
        will have to come to Zion.  It will be the only<br />
        people not at war with its neighbor.(63-75)<br /><br />
        49-The heaven and Earth will be shaken.  At the<br />
        sounding of the trump, mountains and Valleys will<br />
        be made smooth.Before the Second Comming, Jacob<br />
        shall flourish in the desert, and the Lamanites<br />
        will blossom as a rose.  Zion will flourish<br />
        upon the hills and rejoice in the place they<br />
        have been gathered.(22-25).<br /><br />
        58-The feast of fat things will first be to<br />
        the rich and learned.  After that comes the<br />
        day of power, when the poor, lame, blind<br />
        and deaf will partake of the supper of <br />
        the Lord, prepared for the Great Day to Come(5-11)<br /><br />
        61-In the Last Days the waters are cursed.<br />
        The day will come when no one is safe on<br />

        be able to come to Zion by water.(14-19)<br /><br />
        77-The seven seals represent the 7<br />
        thousands years of Earth's temporal history.<br />

        over the four quarters of the Earth.  They have<br />
        the everlasting gospel and the power over life<br />
        and death.  The angel coming from the East has<br />
        the seal of God over the tribes of Israel.  He<br />
        stops the destroying angels from hurting the <br />
        earth until the saints can be sealed in the<br />
        forehead.  These things will happen durring<br />
        the sixth seal or 6 thousand years.  The 144000<br />
        are sealed High Priests after the Holy Order<br />
        of God.  They are ordained out of every nation<br />
        by the 4 angels to bring people to the church of<br />

        of the 7th seal, God will sanctify the Earth and<br />
        redeem all things put in His power.  The trumpets<br />
        are the 7 angels signalling the preparing and <br />
        finishing of His work in the beginning of the <br />
        seventh thousand years.  The preparing of the<br />
        way before the time of His comming.The seventh<br />
        will be opened and Chapter 9 of Revelation will<br />
        be fulfilled before His comming.  John is the<br />
        spirit of Elias that will gather the tribes.<br />

        temple(31-34) Plagues will go forth on the cities<br />
        and nations that reject the word of the Lord and will<br />
        not stop until His comming.  Eventually all will<br />
        know the Lord.  The song of Zion is Given.<br /><br />

        full of truth who will set in order the house of God.<br />

        to the Book of Life and geneology.  A man called<br />
        and appointed by God will try to steady the arc land<br />

        also marshall themselves and will vex the Gentiles.<br />
        There will be bloodshed, famine, earthquakes, thunder<br />
        and lightening.  The inhabitants of the earth will<br />
        suffer until the consumption decreed has made an end<br />
        of all nations.  Stand in holy places until the day<br />
        of the Lord comes(3-8)<br /><br />

        The earth will real to and fro. The sun will be<br />
        darkened.  The moon will be bathed in blood, and<br />
        the stars will fall.  After your testimony comes<br />
        the testimony of earthquakes, and storms, and <br />
        the sea heaving itself beyond its bounds.  Men's<br />
        hearts will fail them.  Angels will fly through<br />
        heaven sounding the trump saying prepare ye, the<br />
        bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him.  This<br />
        will imediately be followed by a great sign in<br />
        heaven and the whole world will see it together.<br />
        Another trump will sound and an angel will<br />
        announce how the great and abominable church is<br />
        bound and ready to be burned.  He will sound his<br />
        trump, and there will be silence in heaven for<br />
        the space of half an hour.  Imediately after<br />
        the half hour, the curtain of heaven will be<br />
        unfolded and the face of the Lord will be unveiled.<br />
        The saints will be caught up, and the saints will <br />
        be resurected and caught up into heaven.This will<br />
        all happen to the sound of the angel's trump.<br />
        Another trump will sound for the resurection of<br />
        the righteous spirits who recieved the gospel<br />
        in the spirit world.  Another trump will sound<br />
        and all the spirits of those under condemnation<br />
        will remain dead until the end of the thousand<br />
        years.The fifth trump is the angel who commiteth<br />
        the everlasting gospel, and he will say:Fear God<br />
        and give glory to God.  The sixth trump will sound<br />
        and it will be announced that the Church of the<br />
        Devil has fallen.  The seventh trump will sound<br />
        and the angel will announce that the lamb has<br />
        overcome.  The angels will be crowned with glory.<br />
        They will recieve their inheritance and be made<br />
        equal with Christ.  7 Trumpets will announce<br />
        the acts of the 7 thousand years and the binding<br />
        of Satan for 1000 years.(84-110)<br /><br />
        90-The gospel will go first to the Gentiles<br />
        and then to the Jews.  Only after that will the<br />
        Lord be revealed in power to the convincing of all<br />
        nations.  Then every man will hear the gospel in<br />
        his own language.(9-11)<br /><br />
