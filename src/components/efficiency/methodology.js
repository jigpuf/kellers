      <li>What are the goals of the project?</li>
      <li>What are the sources of information on the subject?</li>
      <li>What did these sources teach me?</li>
      <li>What rules can I create from the information?</li>
      <li>What are the various options?</li>
      <li>How can I divide my goals into chunks of work or info?</li>
      <li>What do I need in terms of assets to complete the task?  What are the
      costs?</li>
      <li>Is there anything blocking my path?</li>
      <li>What info can be gathered to better best practices?</li>
      <ol>All resources come at the expense of other resources.</ol>
      <ol>The goal is to spend as few resources as possible in order to gain
      more important resources.</ol>

      other resources</ol>
